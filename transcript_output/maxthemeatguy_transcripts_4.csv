PqU8NtHBgCk,Steak Pizza ft. @GugaFoods,today we're making a pizza massive tom and jerry steak with tons of tough cuts that definitely needed tenderizing season both sides and get it on the grill we're smoking over applewood low and slow quick sear and assemble the pizza sauce mozzarella parmesan and pepperoni with all of the essential toppings into the pizza oven pull at 125 crispy cheesy the perfect medium rare pizza
GXpioNviYl4,Everything I ate on a luxury cruise,the best things i ate on a luxury cruise started with a solid and perfectly cooked filet mignon had probably nine slices of pizza but very worth it on the beach had a pretty raw burger but i wasn't mad about it margarita too many espresso martinis and had some smoked swordfish which was light citrusy and very tasty followed by a wine tasting and a field shop that actually blew me away made a quick stop at the casino to lose all my money and felt atrocious the next morning but breakfast was good and for some reason dipped my pancake and milk found a guy behind a grill who is using homemade charcoal and serving the most incredible jerk chicken pork and fresh conk salad it was the teppanyaki guy's very first time on the job but it was extremely entertaining and he wasn't bad then an extremely sober guy ate food off the floor we finished with some osetra caviar and a 36 ounce dry aged tomahawk which had an insane crust and those were

jPAR4KAajVY,Pick Juice Brined Steak,what happens when you brine a steak in pickle juice it keeps chicken juicy but let's see if it works on this large steak one in the fridge and the other in a combination of pickle juice and salt brine for 1 hour 1 hour later it had a pretty repulsive gray color but it actually felt more tender pat dry salt and pepper on the control and just pepper on the pickle and sear the pickle was having a way harder time developing a sear and this less pronounced crust definitely took away from the flavor the control was a standard delicious steak the pickle juice brine was interesting it was actually way more tender but the flavor just wasn't quite right it wasn't bad but it sort of tastes like pickles
bHgUL_W62sE,Pork Skin Chip,this is a pork skin chip carefully remove the skin and add to a dehydrator at 165 for the pork belly sriracha salt and barbecue rub on both sides and get it on the grill we're smoking over applewood low and slow to cut through the richness a tangy salsa avocado onion some mango lime juice for acidity and cilantro one day later our pork skin is completely dried out add to some hot oil and like magic it immediately puffs up and it is insanely crispy after eight hours we have great color on our pork and slicing into it unbelievably juicy with a massive smoke ring crispy skin tender pork to me this is the perfect bite
JJeznbuGEAI,The Steak Review: IHOP,this is the steak review and we're here at ihop t-bone dinner the first thing i noticed was a sad and inconsistent crust the strip was medium rare but the fillet was overcooked let's go for a bite it was on the chewier side and unfortunately the flavor was lacking perhaps ketchup was the answer absolutely zero improvement fortunately the pancakes saved the day light and fluffy those are incredible the big issue was that the steak was cut so thin with no chance of a flavorful crust with that a final score of 38 out of a hundred
bFRKVoR_Bsg,Dry Aged Bologna,today we're dry aging a whole bologna we're starting with the biggest hot dog i've ever seen and into the dry ager for 90 days three months later it was hard as a rock but it lost 40 percent of its weight it was not a grower slicing into it it had a dark outer ring but the inside still looked fresh most importantly how does it taste the texture was more firm and while the flavor was good i really don't have any plans on doing this ever again
6PDJXdjnWM4,My mom forced me to play the violin,my mom forced me to play the violin growing up my parents were pretty laid back but they had one hard rule if i wanted to live in their house i needed to play an instrument for a reason i do not understand at the age of three i decided that that instrument would be the violin every monday for 15 years my mom picked up me and my siblings from school with either pizza or mcdonald's in the car and we drove to our two hour violin lessons a drive that to this day gives me anxiety at first apparently i enjoyed it but as time went on i started hating as the kid who played classical violin i didn't really fall into the category of quote-unquote cool and to say i was a bad student was an understatement every week i watched as disappointment filled the face of my teacher she realized i barely made any progress but even with minimal practice 15 years worth of lessons will get you pretty good at something and as an adult i've finally been able to appreciate what my mom did for me for one it's allowed for opportunities like playing at friends weddings it's also left me feeling incredibly grateful to have parents who gave me opportunities to grow even though it meant that

rzkrJ7T-HSA,The Steak Review: Cracker Barrel,this is the steak review and we're here at cracker barrel sirloin medium rare the first thing i noticed was that it was extremely thin but the crust wasn't terrible let's slice into it cooked closer to medium but not a bad internal temp for a steak that thin pretty good flavor and it was seasoned well but there was a lot of chewing i could barely get that down went for the mashed potatoes honestly the sides are nothing special and as usual tried one piece with ketchup that's not good definitely not the best steak i've ever had but i came in here with pretty low expectations and it's not terrible so with that a final score 51 out of a hundred
GZx2n_sOGj8,Should steaks be left at room temp before cooking?,should steaks actually be left at room temp before cooking one half of the strip is being left in the fridge the other left at room temp for one hour after 60 minutes it's only increased by 15 degrees same seasonings evenly heated pan and sear flipping the same amount of times pulling each at 116 internal interestingly the crusts were identical they finished cooking within 30 seconds of each other and slicing into them they actually look the same similar color and gray band leaving stakes out isn't worth the time instead try dry browning for significantly better results [music]
5aAdnro2mx8,Do 15lb lobsters taste bad? ft. @NickDiGiovanni,what tastes better a small lobster a big lobster or red lobster i've always heard big lobsters taste bad so let's find out luckily nick had a 13 pounder in his trunk it's w time to cook to a pot we added the big lobster a small lobster and in the meantime i ordered one more lobster from the restaurant 45 minutes later we had all three lobsters ready to go we started by tasting the small lobsters they were both equally tender and juicy next the big one getting it open definitely was n easy but unfortunately the rumors were true it was more chewy and less sweet and yeah not worth it
1LcH86evTyI,How to grill a porterhouse,this is how i like to grill a porterhouse steak oil binder salt pepper garlic powder and get it on the grill flip frequently for even cooking the fillet will naturally cook faster due to its size so focus the heat on the larger strip finish by basting with herb butter for a quick final sear notice how the crust is focused on that strip side which has allowed us relatively even cooking on both muscles while sous-vide is a more fool-proof method
dU_dDHh_LMY,The doctor said I need to eat more fish…,the doctor said i need to eat more fish so let's do it this is the best smoked salmon i've ever made season the salmon and get it on the grill packed with omega-3s and nutrients i'd consider going pescetarian after this one
MY9l1G6aT_I,The time I got stood up on a date 💔,i'm going to tell you about the time i got stood up on a date a few years ago there was a food fair at a local brewery in shanghai and i was helping my friends sell sausages a girl walked in wearing a red dress and i distinctly remember she had airpods on and was sort of dancing around she lit up the whole room she started pulling out wheels of cheese and turns out she was a gourmet cheese dealer needless to say i was very interested i was cooking sausages she was selling cheese and throughout the fair i went over to her booth probably 20 times to try the cheese aka find time to talk to her we got along well and ended up going on a few dates one day i offered to cook for her prime grade porter house which is impossible to find in china mashed potatoes salad wine dessert and even candles the food was ready the minutes ticked by but after an hour she texted me saying she couldn't make it granted i don't think she realized i went all out with the cooking but still oof i called my roommates out of their rooms and though they made fun of me the entire time we enjoyed the food and had a good time things eventually fizzled out between us but i figured that today

0y2ntUU5n04,Car Cooking: Red Lobster @NickDiGiovanni,i got this beautiful lobster and we're here red lobster one lobster roll but hold the lobster sorry we don't have those okay just the biscuits please i got ready to boil the lobster when all of a sudden we had a visitor now i have no idea why nick had a 15-pound lobster in his trunk but i'm pretty sure it blew this guy's mind bad day to be a big lobster great day to be a small lobster and get your pot fired up things got emotional for nick while it cooked but after a 45-minute spa session it was ready remove the claws for a quick lobster shotgun and let nick finish the job with thor's hammer and we're left with massive chunks of tender lobster mayo chives lemon salt and pepper red lobsters first ever lobster roll car cooked to perfection

NqHZXM3RB9Q,The day I fell in love,i'm going to tell you about the day i fell in love 8 years ago i was living in shanghai china my colleagues knew i was obsessed with grilling and surprised me by taking us to a steakhouse called char located on top of a hotel with stunning views overlooking the most vibrant part of the city the event was called a stake master class hosted by the head chef and it started with a powerpoint presentation now usually i hate powerpoints but this was different he started by explaining the differences between angus and wagu breeds marbling scores and all the different cuts on a cow it was the first and only presentation where i actively internalized everything that was said next came a tour of the dry aging room and after some begging they even let kyle and i cook a steak and i was hooked i went home and fell back into my old job and routine but that day a switch went off in my head i realized this could be more than a hobby within the layers was a lifetime of things to learn i knew that what i had experienced would be a big part of my life and it was only a matter of time before i made it happen

Ms7gIC6i_sA,Duck Fat Chip 🦆,this is a duck fat chip by removing the fat from our duck breast we can optimally cook both sides season the breast with salt and pepper five spice and orange zest we're smoking over applewood low and slow and get started on the chip score for better rendering season with salt and render on low heat with a weight on top what's left is completely rendered and crispy duck fat quick sear at 125 internal for the perfect rosy pink medium rare plate with a parsnip puree and a blood orange balsamic glaze the contrast from the tender duck and crispy fat is unlike anything that can be achieved on the grill or even a pan and the reason is that

MshH6ajPKP4,Butter Injected Lobster 🦞,we're gonna inject this lobster with butter huge lobster with claws the same size as my sister's hand butter lemon and cajun injections the most humane way to do it inject the tail and completely fill both claws fully vaccinated with a whole stick of butter and steam bright orange tail from the cajun seasonings quick lobster shotgun and cut yourself multiple times trying to open those claws this method provides buttery and seasoned lobster the alternative via normal person and dip
