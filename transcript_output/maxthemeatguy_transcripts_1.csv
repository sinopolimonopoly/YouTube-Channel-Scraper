bwaM4sQS1Ek,Trimming a Dry Aged Brisket #shorts,trimming and preparing a dry aged brisket after 50 days notice the hard and dry exterior that we need to slice away the first thing i noticed was that some of the fat had turned green but still smelled okay notice that incredible marbling i then moved over to the flat leaving about a quarter of an inch of fat the bottom section i tried to remove only as much as necessary since there wasn't any fat protecting it unlike a fresh brisket the color of the red meat was extremely vivid and the fat was actually rendering at room temp this is one of the juiciest briskets i've ever cooked and the nutty blue cheese dry age flavor was still very apparent even after the 10 hours of smoking
rrhB85u122o,The Steak Review: The Outback #shorts,this is the safe review and we're here at the outback bone-in ribeye medium rare also a blooming onion let's do it and set up shop using a sophisticated weighted formula we're on a mission to find the best steak in america so far i've had a great experience all the employees have been extremely nice in the bathroom solid so let's check out this steak overall we have a pretty decent char though a slight lack of consistency in the middle it's about a half an inch thick with a nice and defined cap muscle which is exactly what i'm looking for let's cut it to it so as you can see we have a perfect medium rare a little gray band but pretty minimal this is cooked almost perfectly not bad we're just doing a steak review oh no that's fine overall this is a pretty good steak definitely grilled over fire it is a little bit bland and could definitely use more salt and pepper blooming onion this tasted like a choice grade rib eye for 28 bucks that isn't bad but strong seasonings or even a sauce would have gone a long way in elevating the average meat quality the final score 73 out of 100
